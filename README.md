More places to learn about purrr and iteration:

  * The [Iteration chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration.html) of R for Data
    Science 2e *this has the most "current" take on where purrr fits within the
    tidyverse, especially w.r.t. dplyr and tidyr*
  * [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) *caveat: this is
    somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * [Row-oriented workflows in R with the tidyverse](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows#readme)  *caveat:
    this is somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * tidyr's [Rectangling vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html)
  * dplyr's [Row-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html)
  * dplyr's [Column-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html)
